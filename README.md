# Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Azure

**BREAKING CHANGE**: version 4.0.0 removed the deprecated event hub input. Use the [Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/) to collect event hub data. Refer to the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for more detail.

Install `ucc-gen` [per the instructions](https://splunk.github.io/addonfactory-ucc-generator/#installation). Then, execute the following from the command line in the root of this repository to build the add-on:
